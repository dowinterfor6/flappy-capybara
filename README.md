An experimentation with simple Javascript and <canvas> manipulation in HTML, to implement a flappy-bird clone based off the App Academy project guidlines. Scripts have been compiled into a single file and uploaded by masking this as a PHP project (webpack was producing too many errors when attempting to upload as a Node.js project). Original repository is <a href="https://github.com/dowinterfor6/flappy-bird-clone">here</a>. There's mediocre CSS, inefficient JS, absolutely no refactoring, no high score database, and some random music (unfortunately not the death metal that a friend requested).
